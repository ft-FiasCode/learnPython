🦄 Core Features
Here's what you'll master with this guide:

Comments: Single-line (#) and multi-line (""") documentation

Math Operations: +, -, *, /, //, %, ** with proper precedence

Boolean Logic: True, False, and, or, not

Comparisons: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, is

String Formatting: f-strings, concatenation, indexing

Data Structures: Lists, tuples, dicts, sets, collections

Advanced: Generators, functions, classes, inheritance, properties

🎯 Quick Examples:
python
# Math
print(10 // 3)  # 3 (floor division)
print(2 ** 3)   # 8 (exponentiation)

# Strings
name = "Python"
print(f"{name} has {len(name)} letters.")  # Python has 6 letters.

# Booleans
print(True and False)  # False
print(1 < 2 < 10)      # True (chained comparison)
👩🏽‍🍳 Learning Path
I started with the basics—comments and numbers—because they're the foundation. Next came booleans and comparisons since they're essential for decision-making.

Then I covered strings because they're everywhere in programming. After mastering the built-in types (lists, tuples, dicts, sets), we dive into collections for advanced data handling.

Functions come next since they're the building blocks of reusable code. Finally, classes, inheritance, and properties show how Python handles object-oriented programming.

Each section builds on the previous one. The key insight? Master the basics first—they unlock everything else. Documenting as you learn (like this README) helps solidify understanding.

📚 What You'll Learn
🧠 Core Python Thinking:
Order of Operations: Parentheses control precedence

Truthiness: True=1, False=0 in math contexts

Identity vs Equality: is vs ==

Mutable vs Immutable: Lists change, tuples don't

📏 Data Structure Mastery:
Lists: [1, 2, 3] - ordered, mutable

Tuples: (1, 2, 3) - ordered, immutable

Dicts: {"key": "value"} - key-value pairs

Sets: {1, 2, 3} - unique, unordered

🎨 Advanced Patterns:
Generators: Memory-efficient iteration with yield

Functions: Parameters, returns, *args, **kwargs

Classes: self, __init__, methods

Inheritance: Extending base classes

Properties: @property decorators for clean getters/setters

💭 Next Steps for Mastery
Practice with coding challenges (LeetCode, HackerRank)

Build small projects (calculator, to-do list)

Explore list comprehensions: [x*2 for x in range(5)]

Learn error handling with try/except

Dive into modules and packages

Master virtual environments (venv)
